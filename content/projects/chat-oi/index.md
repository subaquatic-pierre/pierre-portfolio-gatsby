text: This application is a simple web chat application that allows real time web chat. The application uses the Socket IO library to allow for realtime interaction with the server, via AJAX requests. When first visiting the site users are requested to enter a login name, the page then updates with the full web chat application. Once the user is logged in they have access to user controls which include creating a room, leaving a room and login out.
